/**
 * Base class for classes in the model.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Represents:</b> class
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage:</b>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Inherit from this class to define classes of the model. Fields of the
 * subclass will represent attributes of the model class, methods will represent
 * operations, while inheritance between subclasses of <code>ModelClass</code>
 * will represent inheritance in the model. That means, due to the restrictions
 * of Java, each model class may have at most one base class.
 * <p>
 * See the documentation of {@link StateMachine} about applying state machines
 * to model classes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Java restrictions:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>Instantiate:</i> disallowed</li>
 * <li><i>Define subtype:</i> allowed
 * <p>
 * <b>Subtype requirements:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>must be a top level class (not a nested or local class)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Subtype restrictions:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>Be abstract:</i> disallowed</li>
 * <li><i>Generic parameters:</i> disallowed</li>
 * <li><i>Constructors:</i> allowed, only with parameters of types which are
 * subclasses of <code>ModelClass</code> or primitives (including {@code String}
 * )</li>
 * <li><i>Initialization blocks:</i> allowed, containing only simple assignments
 * to set the default values of its fields</li>
 * <li><i>Fields:</i> allowed, only of types which are subclasses of
 * <code>ModelClass</code> or primitives (including {@code String}); they
 * represent attributes of the model class</li>
 * <li><i>Methods:</i> allowed, only with parameters and return values of types
 * which are subclasses of <code>ModelClass</code> or primitives (including
 * {@code String}); they represent operations of the model class</li>
 * <li><i>Nested interfaces:</i> disallowed</li>
 * <li><i>Nested classes:</i> allowed, only non-static and extending either
 * {@link StateMachine.Vertex} or {@link StateMachine.Transition}</li>
 * <li><i>Nested enums:</i> disallowed</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li><i>Inherit from the defined subtype:</i> allowed, to represent class
 * inheritance</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * class Employee extends ModelClass {
 * 
 * 	String name;
 * 
 * 	int id;
 * 
 * 	void work(int hours, int payment) {
 * 		{@literal //...}
 * 	}
